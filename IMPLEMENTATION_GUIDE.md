## 🔐 Security Considerations

### **⚠️ Important Security Fixes Needed**

Before deploying to production, address these critical issues:

1. **Move Secrets to Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   # Create .env file
   SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
   EMAIL_HOST_USER=your-email
   EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=your-password
   ```

2. **Update settings.py**
   ```python
   import os
   from dotenv import load_dotenv
   
   load_dotenv()
   SECRET_KEY = os.getenv('SECRET_KEY')
   ```

3. **Remove @csrf_exempt**
   - Implement proper CSRF token handling
   - Use Django's built-in CSRF protection

4. **Add Input Validation**
   - Use Django Forms for validation
   - Sanitize user inputs
